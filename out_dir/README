To use my ploting codes I do need the galaxy distance in MPC. I used 1 Mpc just to having a number. So, do not use SFR for notting.
I will send the pyligth code to you. So far I think it is not a good idea to put it in a public folder as in git. That is why I'm not uploading it here, only the plots.
